    val isUserCorrected: Boolean,
    val userCategory: String? // if corrected
)
Create DocumentDao (insert, query, search, delete)
Verify database is encrypted (check with DB browser)

Day 7: Basic Navigation Shell
Bottom nav bar with 3 tabs: 📄 Documents | 🔍 Search | ⚙️ Settings
Empty screens for each tab
App icon and splash screen
END OF WEEK 1 TEST:
Open app → fingerprint prompt → empty home screen
Kill app → reopen → fingerprint again
Database exists and is encrypted
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WEEK 2 — File Scanning + Storage Access
GOAL: App scans phone storage, finds all document-like files, and shows them in a list

Day 1-2: Permission Handling
Request READ_MEDIA_IMAGES (Android 13+)
Request READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (Android 12 and below)
Build friendly permission explanation screen:
"DocVault needs to see your files to find documents. Nothing ever leaves your phone."
Handle permission denied gracefully
Handle "Don't ask again" case

Day 3-4: MediaStore Scanner
Build FileScanner class that queries MediaStore for:
All images (JPEG, PNG, HEIC, WebP)
All PDFs
All documents (DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX)
For each file found, collect:
File path
File size
Date modified
MIME type
MD5 hash (for duplicate detection)
Filter OUT non-document images:
Skip files < 50 KB (probably memes/stickers)
Skip files from known app folders (TikTok, Instagram cache, etc.)
Keep files from: Downloads, WhatsApp, Camera, Documents, DCIM

Day 5-6: Scan Results UI
Build scanning progress screen:
"Scanning your files..."
"Found 142 files... checking for documents..."
Progress bar with count
Build results list showing:
Thumbnail
Filename
File size
Source folder (Downloads, WhatsApp, etc.)
Show results AS they are found (not after completion)

Day 7: Duplicate Detection
Compare MD5 hashes of all found files
Group duplicates together
Show badge: "3 duplicates found"
Let user pick which copy to keep
END OF WEEK 2 TEST:
Hit "Scan" → app finds files from storage
Shows list of found documents with thumbnails
Duplicates are flagged
Nothing is imported yet, just discovered
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


WEEK 3 — PDF Conversion + Encrypted Import
GOAL: Found files are converted to PDF and stored in encrypted app storage

Day 1-2: Image → PDF Conversion
Build PdfConverter class
For image files (JPG, PNG, HEIC):
Load bitmap
Auto-rotate based on EXIF data
Create PDF using Android PdfDocument API
Save to app's private encrypted storage
For existing PDFs:
Copy to encrypted storage (no conversion needed)
For Office docs (DOC, XLSX):
Store as-is for v1 (conversion is complex)
Mark as "non-PDF" in database
Generate thumbnail for each document

Day 3-4: Encrypted File Storage
Create EncryptedFileManager class
Every PDF saved is encrypted with AES-256:
Generate per-file encryption key
Store key in Android Keystore
Encrypted file: .vault extension
File structure in app private storage:
/data/data/com.docvault/vault/
documents/
abc123.vault (encrypted PDF)
def456.vault
thumbnails/
abc123_thumb.vault
def456_thumb.vault
Decryption only when user opens a document

Day 5-6: Import Flow
From scan results, user taps "Import All" or selects files
Batch processing with progress:
"Importing 47 documents..."
"Converting image 12 of 47..."
For each file:
Convert to PDF (if image)
Encrypt the PDF
Generate encrypted thumbnail
Calculate hash
Save record to encrypted database
Skip if hash already exists (duplicate)
After import, ask:
"Delete 47 original files to free 234 MB?"
[Yes, delete originals] [No, keep them]

Day 7: Document Viewer
Tap any document in list → opens in-app PDF viewer
Decrypt file temporarily to display
Pinch to zoom
Clean up temp decrypted file when viewer closes
END OF WEEK 3 TEST:
Scan → select files → import → see them in vault
Tap document → view PDF inside app
Files are encrypted on disk
Originals can be deleted
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


WEEK 4 — AI: OCR + Text Extraction
GOAL: App reads text from every document using OCR

Day 1-2: Google ML Kit Setup
Add ML Kit Text Recognition dependency: com.google.mlkit:text-recognition
Build OcrEngine class
For image-based documents:
Feed bitmap to ML Kit
Get back structured text blocks
Store full extracted text in database
For existing PDFs:
Extract text using PdfRenderer
If PDF has no text (scanned PDF) → render page to bitmap → run OCR on bitmap

Day 3-4: Metadata Extraction
Build MetadataExtractor class
From extracted text, use regex patterns to find:
Dates (multiple formats: DD/MM/YYYY, Jan 15 2025, etc.)
Money amounts ($123.45, ₹1,234, etc.)
Names (look for "Name:", "Patient:", "To:" patterns)
Document numbers (Invoice #, Policy #, etc.)
Store as JSON metadata blob in database

Day 5-6: Auto-Generated Titles
Build TitleGenerator class
Logic (rule-based, not ML needed):
Find most prominent entity in text
Combine with document type hint + date
Examples:
"IMG_20250615.jpg" → "Amazon_Receipt_Jun2025.pdf"
"download.pdf" → "Electricity_Bill_May2025.pdf"
"photo_384.jpg" → "Passport_JohnDoe.pdf"
User can always rename manually

Day 7: Integrate OCR into Import Pipeline
Updated import flow:
Convert to PDF
Run OCR
Extract metadata
Generate title
Encrypt and store
Show extracted text on document detail screen
END OF WEEK 4 TEST:
Import a receipt photo → app reads the text
Shows extracted amount, date, vendor
Auto-generated filename makes sense
Import a passport photo → reads name, number
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


WEEK 5 — AI: Auto-Categorization
GOAL: AI automatically sorts documents into categories

Day 1-2: Define Categories + Training Approach
Categories for v1:
📋 ID & Personal (passport, license, Aadhaar, etc.)
💰 Financial (bank statements, tax docs)
🧾 Receipts (shopping, restaurant, online orders)
🏥 Medical (prescriptions, lab reports, bills)
🎓 Education (certificates, marksheets, transcripts)
🚗 Vehicle (RC, insurance, PUC, service records)
🏠 Property (rent agreement, electricity, water)
📄 Other (everything else)
TWO classification approaches (use both):
Approach A — Keyword matching (fast, simple, ~70% accurate):
"passport" / "republic of india" → ID
"prescription" / "diagnosis" → Medical
"invoice" / "total" / "subtotal" → Receipt
"semester" / "university" / "grade" → Education
Approach B — TensorFlow Lite model (slower, ~90% accurate):
Train a simple text classifier
Input: extracted OCR text
Output: category with confidence score
Use Approach A as fallback when B is unsure

Day 3-4: Build Keyword Classifier
Create KeywordClassifier class
Define keyword lists for each category
Scoring system:
Each keyword match = +1 point for that category
Weighted keywords (e.g., "passport" = +5, "date" = +1)
Highest scoring category wins
If top two are close → mark as "unsure"
Test with 20-30 real documents from your phone

Day 5-6: Build ML Classifier (Optional for v1)
Option A (Recommended for v1): Skip this, keyword is enough
Option B (If you want ML):
Use a pre-trained text classification model
Fine-tune with ~100 labeled document texts
Export as TFLite model
Run on-device
Use keyword classifier as fallback

Day 7: Category UI + User Correction
Home screen shows categories as cards/folders:
[📋 ID (12)] [💰 Finance (8)] [🧾 Receipts (23)]
[🏥 Medical (5)] [🎓 Education (7)] ...
Each document shows AI-assigned category with badge
Long press any document → "Change category" → Show all categories → user picks correct one
Save correction in database:
isUserCorrected = true
userCategory = "Medical" (what user picked)
category = "Receipt" (what AI thought)
This data will improve AI later
END OF WEEK 5 TEST:
Import 20 documents → AI categorizes them
Home screen shows organized folders
Tap folder → see documents inside
Wrong category? → long press → fix it
At least 70% should be categorized correctly
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


WEEK 6 — Search + Camera Capture + Share Intent
GOAL: Find any document instantly, capture new ones easily

Day 1-2: Full-Text Search
Build search screen
Search across:
Document title
Extracted OCR text
Category name
Metadata (vendor name, amounts)

@Fts4
@Entity(tableName = "document_fts")
data class DocumentFts(
    val title: String,
    val extractedText: String,
    val category: String
)
Search results show:
Document thumbnail
Title
Text snippet with search term highlighted
Category badge
Search should feel instant (<200ms)

Day 3-4: Camera Capture
Add floating "+" button on home screen
Tap → options:
📷 Scan document (camera)
📁 Pick from files

User takes photo of paper document
Show preview: "Use this photo?"
Optional: crop / rotate
Process: convert → OCR → categorize → save
Show result: "Saved as Medical document"
File picker flow:
Open system file picker
User selects any file
Import and process same as above

Day 5-6: Share TO App (Incoming Intent)
Register intent filters in AndroidManifest.xml:
<action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND" />
<category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
<data android:mimeType="image/*" />
<data android:mimeType="application/pdf" />
When user shares any file TO DocVault:
Receive the file
Show quick preview
Process: convert → OCR → categorize → save
Confirm: "Saved to Medical"
WhatsApp example: User receives PDF → Share → DocVault → done

Day 7: Share FROM App (Outgoing)
On document detail screen, add share button
Flow:
Decrypt the PDF temporarily
Open Android share sheet
User picks WhatsApp / Email / Drive / etc.
File shared
Delete temp decrypted file
Add "Download" button:
Saves decrypted PDF to Downloads folder
Shows confirmation: "Saved to Downloads"
END OF WEEK 6 TEST:
Search "passport" → finds your passport
Camera button → snap paper → auto-saved and categorized
WhatsApp → Share PDF → DocVault → imported
